# Longhack2023: AGen-iNET

## GitHub repo of Longhack project

The idea is to develop an end-to-end platform to analyse sequencing data and retrive biological meaningful information.

The novelty reside in:
- First **REAL** end-to-end analysis platform (no code required, no secondary analysis, no pre-processing)
- Novel algorithm that integrate diffentially expressed genes, expression, mutational profile to priori knowledge of aging and selected diseases
- The results can be directly used to identify biomarkers and potential drug targets

The project is devided in 3 sub-teams:
- Front-end developmnet with a focus on the user to create an accessible GUI
- back-end development:
  - pipeline development: building a robust pipeline for the analysis of sequencing data to ensure reproducibility, stability and speed of the analysis
  - network analysis: development of novel algorithms for the network analysis, for our knowlede is the first algorithm that integrate meaningfully 
 several layer of informations for the sequencing data to priori knowledge of two conditions (Diseaee|Aging). The results aren't simply data-driven, 
 but projected on the up-todate biological/clinical knowledge.
